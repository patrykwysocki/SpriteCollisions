### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone repository
* Ensure `SFML_SDK` environment variable exits
* Select a project default target `x64` when running executable
* If the project builds but does not `xcopy` the required dll's try moving your project to a directory you have full access to, see http://tinyurl.com/SFMLStarter for a guide on post build events.
* Alternatively set the Environment Variable in Configuration Properties | Debugging | Environment to `PATH=%PATH%;%SFML_SDK%\bin` this will ensure DLL's are discoverable when running in debug mode with copying the DLL's to the executable directory
* Useful resource on Conditional (ternary) operator http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/14631/
